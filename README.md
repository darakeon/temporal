# Temporal Example

This is a code created to be used as sandbox for temporal tests and
learning.

This is builded to run inside Ubuntu. I use windows with WSL2 Ubuntu
virtual machine to run it.


## Run example

`make install`

Installs Temporal at Ubuntu machines to allow running this project


`make server`

Runs a Temporal service locally in port 7233, exposing the UI for the
server at http://localhost:8080.


`make start`

Install npm dependencies and start the worker that will pull Temporal
tasks, in watch mode.


`make run`

Create and run a workflow with a ID generated by bash tools. The ID is
stored in the file last_workflow_id.txt, which is ignored by the version
control. Everytime this command is run the **last_workflow_id.txt** file
will be **overwritten**.


`make show`

Show the status of the last workflow sent by `make run` command.
